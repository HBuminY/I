                A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're
                adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the
                floated image.

                As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would
                look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on
                and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not
                really be read.

                And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more
                insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that
                here.
